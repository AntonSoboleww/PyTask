# Flask Task App

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to create their own tasks and provide them for others to solve. The application leverages the Python programming language and includes a built-in compiler to execute the submitted solutions.

The application has been created for portfolio. The development time spent on this project was 2 days.

The application has some shortcomings. For example, the security system limits imports and the execution of certain functions instead of isolating potentially malicious code using Docker containers.
Additionally, the comments throughout the code are scattered in a haphazard manner. Some sections have comments (left behind during breaks), while others lack them (constituting a significant portion of the code).
Nevertheless, the project successfully fulfills its core functionality and, in my opinion, serves as a suitable showcase to capture the interest of recruiters. Thank you for your time and attention!

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
